.SH NAME
lhs2TeX \- a literate Haskell to (La)TeX code translator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lhs2TeX
[options]
file

.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool takes as its input a literate Haskell source
file (Bird-style or LaTeX-style or even a combination thereof),
and produces output, which, depending on the
.B STYLE
selected, can be either a LaTeX document or a stripped version
of the code. 
The output is produced on stdout.
Several directives are interpreted by
.B lhs2TeX
itself and can be used to customize the output further.

.SH OPTIONS
There are two sorts of options for 
\fBlhs2TeX\fR. The first selects a
.B STYLE
which governs the overal mode of operation for 
\fBlhs2TeX\fR. Only one style may be selected:


.TP
.B --poly
The poly style is an improvement of the older
.B math
style. It produces a LaTeX document, with the code blocks
formatted using a proportional font. The output is highly customizable
using formatting directives. Furthermore, the resulting code
respects some of the alignments made in the source file.

.TP
.B --math
The math style is as
.B poly
style, but has less alignment capabilities. Tokens appearing in the
source file at a special column are all aligned in the
output. Furthermore, indentation is respected.

.TP
.B --newcode
In the new code style, everything but code blocks is stripped from
the file. In addition, certain syntactic transformations can be
performed on the code using formatting directives. For example, if
the source code is annotated in certain positions to produce even
nicer results in
.B poly
style, one can use
.B newcode
style to remove these annotations.

.TP
.B --code
In code style, all comments and specification code is stripped from
the file, so that only the code remains. Use this if you want to
produce a smaller version of your source file.

.TP
.B --tt
Typewriter style prints code almost verbatim, using a monospaced font,
but formatting certain symbols (lambda abstraction, arrows ...) using
an extended character set. This style is default if no style is
explicitly selected, but this behaviour should not be relied upon.
The default style may be changed in future versions.

.TP
.B --verb
Verbatim style prints code as-is, using a monospaced font. No
formatting whatsoever is applied to the code. However,
.B lhs2TeX
does not make use of a LaTeX verbatim environment, but rather
escapes special TeX constructs in the translation. This implies that
it is easier to pass the resulting TeX code to macros or use it
inside certain environments than it would be with a native
verbatim-environment.

.PD
.PP
The following options are considered are also considered as styles,
but return only information about the program:

.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB-?\fR, \fB--help\fR
Returns a short usage message listing all the available options.

.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Returns version information. 

.TP
.B --copying
Displays the complete GNU General Public License.

.TP
.B --warranty
Displays the parts of the GPL than concerns warranty.

.PD
.PP
The remaining options modify the behaviour of the program.

.TP
\fB-P\fIpath\fR, \fB--path=\fIpath\fR
Takes a (colon-separated) list
.I path
of paths that are used
as search path for files to be included. If the list starts
with a colon, then the list is appended to the current
search path. If the list ends with a colon, then the list
is prepended to the current search path. If there is neither
a colon at the beginning nor at the end of the list, then
the list replaces the current search path. 

Environment
variables can be used in the list of paths, if enclosed
in curly braces, i.e.,
.I {VAR}
expands to the current value of the environment variable
VAR. If a path ends with a double slash 
\fI//\fR, then all subdirectories
of that path are included in the search path. Note that this
can significantly slow down
.B lhs2TeX
when looking for files.

The built-in default search path of
.B lhs2TeX
is

.nf
   {HOME}/lhs2TeX//
   {HOME}/.lhs2TeX//
   {LHS2TEX}//
   /usr/local/share/lhs2tex//
   /usr/local/share/lhs2TeX//
   /usr/local/lib/lhs2tex//
   /usr/local/lib/lhs2TeX//
   /usr/share/lhs2tex//
   /usr/share/lhs2TeX//
   /usr/lib/lhs2tex//
   /usr/lib/lhs2TeX//
.fi

.TP
\fB-i\fIfile\fR, \fB--include=\fIfile\fR
Includes
.I file
before anything else. This option has the same effect
as an

.nf
   %include \fIfile\fR
.fi

directive at the beginning of the source file.

.TP
\fB-l\fIequation\fR, \fB--let=\fIequation\fR
Assumes
.I equation
while processing the source file. This option has the
same effect as a

.nf
   %let \fIequation\fR
.fi

directive at the beginning of the source file.

.TP
\fB-s\fIflag\fR, \fB--set=\fIflag\fR
Sets
.I flag
to
.B True
at the beginning of the source file. This option has
the same effect as a

.nf
   %let \fIflag\fR=True
.fi

at the beginning of the source file.

.TP
\fB-u\fIflag\fR, \fB--unset=\fIflag\fR
Sets
.I flag
to
.B False
at the beginning of the source file. This option has
the same effect as a

.nf
   %let \fIflag\fR=False
.fi

at the beginning of the source file.
